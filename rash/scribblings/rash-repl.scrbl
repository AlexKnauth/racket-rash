@title{RASH repl}

THIS IS ALL ALPHA AND UNSTABLE

To launch a rash repl, run @code{racket -l rash/repl}, or if you have
your racket's @code{bin} dir on your path, you can run
@code{rash-repl}.


This repl is very rough.  It is basically awful.  At this point it is
just something I cooked up really quick because I wanted to have a
repl.  Eventually, I hope to make a nice, usable repl.

The syntax in the repl is the same as in @code{#lang rash}.
