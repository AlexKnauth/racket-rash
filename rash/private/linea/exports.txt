This could be spun off as a separate package if I decide it is useful for anything outside of Rash.  I separated it from the rest of Rash so it would be possible (and to have a cleaner design), but I'm not sure that will ever be worthwhile.

Besides, I may think of an even better reader layer than this.  It's a lot smaller than, say, the pipelining stuff.

Exports of this sub-package to document:

 linea-read-syntax
 linea-read-syntax-all
 linea-read
 linea-read-all
 linea-stx-strs->stx

 linea-line-parse

 do-line-macro
 default-line-macro
 define-line-macro

 prop:line-macro
 line-macro?
