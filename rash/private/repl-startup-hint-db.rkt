     "You can use the `help` line macro to get help about topics."
     "You can use the `raco docs` command to look up documentation for Racket functions and macros.  Try running `raco docs rash`."
     "You can use the `man` command to get documentation about programs.  Try running `man man`."

     TODO -- add good hints!
     I imagine good hints will include:
     * keyboard shortcuts (when there is a good line editor)
     * useful unix commands that people should know about
     * useful Racket functions for shell usage
     * tips about making aliases, etc
     * tips about automating things you run frequently
     * tips about features people might not be familiar with
