This is a shell language, library, and REPL for Racket.

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/sHiBRIlSM9wHDetDhsVjrCaZi.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/sHiBRIlSM9wHDetDhsVjrCaZi)

Use as a repl that is as convenient for pipelining programs as Bash
is, but has all the power of Racket.  Use as a scripting language with
`#lang rash`.  Embed in normal Racket files, and mix freely with any
other Racket language or library.

Online documentation is [here](http://docs.racket-lang.org/rash@rash/index.html).
After installing with `raco pkg install rash`, documentation
is available locally by running `raco docs rash`.

FYI

Tab completion and line editing is not yet in the master branch until
some upstream things make their way through the pipeline.
